/**
 * @fileoverview Storage and Provider Interfaces for @dotdo/gitx
 *
 * These interfaces define the storage abstraction that allows the core
 * git implementation to work with any storage backend (memory, file system,
 * R2, KV, etc.) without any platform-specific dependencies.
 *
 * Implementations of these interfaces are provided by platform-specific
 * packages like gitx.do for Cloudflare Workers.
