/**
 * @fileoverview Core Type Definitions (Platform Agnostic)
 *
 * This module defines the storage abstraction interfaces and common types
 * used throughout the core git implementation. These interfaces are designed
 * to be implemented by platform-specific backends (Node.js fs, Cloudflare R2, etc.)
 *
 * This module has ZERO Cloudflare dependencies and can run in any JavaScript runtime.
