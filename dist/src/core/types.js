/**
 * @fileoverview Core Type Definitions (Platform Agnostic)
 *
 * This module re-exports the canonical storage interfaces from types/storage
 * and defines additional platform-agnostic types for git operations.
 * These interfaces are designed to be implemented by platform-specific
 * backends (Node.js fs, Cloudflare R2, etc.)
 *
 * This module has ZERO Cloudflare dependencies and can run in any JavaScript runtime.
